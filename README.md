# routable-challenge

My attempt at the Design code challenge for Routable. This code pertains to the
single page portion of the test, however, Figma links to the email template and
single page design can be found below.

### Design Links

 - **Email Template**: https://www.figma.com/file/DdJbn0Fzy71aA9d27jazck9G/Routable-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1

## Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


## Deployment

For the convenience of the team of Routable, this site has been deployed through
Netlify. [View the live demo here](https://cedric-routable-challenge.netlify.com/).
